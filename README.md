# Otto Blockly for GNU/Linux OS
This is a free and open source visual programming language based on Blockly from Google & MIT, Arduino codes are created by just combining the blocks, then they are compiled (check or verified) and quickly [upload to any Otto robot](https://www.ottodiy.com/) or all kins of Arduino projects.

This is a Linux version for Otto Blockly developed by Antonio Gómez and Mª Dolores Nogueras.It's a project still developing. It works in Ubuntu 20
For [Windows version go here](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly)
Do you want to compile it?

    Install node.js
    Clone the repository
    Run npm install
    If you want to test the software, run npm start
    To compile, run npm run compiler

### Dependencies (nodejs, npm)
Uncomment lines that correspond to your Ubuntu version
```
cd
#curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh #ubuntu-18-04
#curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_15.x -o nodesource_setup.sh #ubuntu-20-04
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install -y nodejs
#nodejs -v #ubuntu-18-04
#node -v #ubuntu-20-04
```
See the following links to install node-js on [ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04) or [ubuntu-20-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04).

### Building project
```
git clone https://github.com/ottodiy/blocklylinux
cd ~/blocklyLinux
npm install
sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/$USER/.config
npm start #to test app
npm run compiler #To compile
```
where `$USER` is a self-explanatory variable. See your `$USER` variable by typing `echo $USER` in the terminal.

### USB connection
First, [make sure that your user is part of the `dialout` group](https://askubuntu.com/a/58122) if it is necessary in your Linux distribution. You can do this with the following command:
```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
You need to **reboot** your machine for the group changes to take effect.

Testing the port of arudino with `Board: Arduino Nano; Processor: ATMega328P; Port:/dev/ttyUSB0`
```
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Sep 13 08:21 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Cleaning project
```
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf package-lock.json
```

## How to use
1. Open Otto Blockly
2. Open any example.
3. Connect your Otto robot.
4. Select `Arduino nano` and USB port where Otto is connected (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`)
5. Check the code.
6. Upload and yes is that easy!
7. Drag , drop, mix, play and create your own codes.
